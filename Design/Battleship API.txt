API overview
------------
- AIs run as separate processes from the main game engine

- They are spawned for each game

- The API will send JSON messages via stdin and stdout

- All interactions are driven from the game engine by sending a message
  to the AI. It responds with a JSON message indicating the action to perform.



Action=START_GAME

- Sent at the start of the game

- Message from game engine

Action=LIGHT_EM_UP

- Message from game engine
  - Budget available for shots (includes any 'saved up' shots)

Processing
----------
- The game engine processes each shot
  - If any shot goes over budget, the initial in-budget ones in the list are processed; out-of-budget ones are ignored

- If not all shots have been used by an AI, any remaining shots are saved up

- The game engine checks whether any of the shots have hit a target

- The game engine checks whether any enemy vessels are completely destroyed



Action=STATUS_UPDATE
--------------------
- Sent after the LIGHT_EM_UP and MOVE phases to let AIs know if they have hit opponents
  and if they have been hit themselves

- Message from game engine
