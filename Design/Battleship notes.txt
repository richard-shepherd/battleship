Overview
--------
AIs play batteleships against each other.


Coding competition criteria
---------------------------
- The challenge has to be easy enough to be accessible
  - But also interesting enough to be a challenge

- Ideally you should be able to write a simple AI in less than an hour
  - But also that there is enough complexity to write more interesting AIs

- There must be no straightforward best solution to the game


Extensions to the standard rules
--------------------------------
- I think that the standard rules are too simple

- I suspect that there is a optimal strategy with the standard rules
  - So this would not give enough scope for AIs to differentiate themselves

- Ideas for rule extensions
  - Moving ships
  - Mines
  - Reconnaissance drones
  - Difference sizes of board (possibly much bigger)
  - Salvo firing (more than one shot per turn)
  - Budget for what you can fire each turn
  - Budget for which ships you start off with

- More than two players?
  - It could be that we play with (say) three or four players at a time
  - I think that could get too complicated, eg alliances
  - And also possibly 'unfair' if players gang up
  - So I think it is best to stick to two players at a time


Moving ships
------------
- This helps avoid the main 'solvability' of the standard game
  - ie, that there could be an optimal algorithm to narrow down where the opponent's ships are

- How many ships should move each turn?

- Maybe each ship can move one square per turn
  - This seems 'realistic', ie that each ship can move

- Perhaps ships can no longer move once they are hit?
  - That might be a shame though as one nice thing would be that a ship can still get away even when it is hit
  - So I think NO to this
  - Otherwise the game seems to devolve to the non moving version
    - ie, you find a ship (somehow) and then blitz it where you find it

- Is it too much if each ship moves each turn?


How do ships move?
------------------
- Ships move one squre per turn

- Ships can move forwards or backwards on the direction of their axis

- Can ships turn?
  - Seems like they should be able to (???)

- How do ships turn?
  - They would need to turn while remaining on the board
  - eg, if they are on the top or bottom row, or near the left or right edges


- I worry that there is a danger of people setting up ships to constantly spin around
  - Possibly around different points (depending on the turning rule)
  - So they end up moving too fast
  - And looking a bit stupid  


- Alternatively, it could be that ships can just 'skip sideways' but stay in their original orientation
  - This does mean that all the ships points change with no overlap
  - Perhaps you can do it, but not every turn?
  - eg, If you skip, then you miss the next movement turn (for that ship?)

- Proposal
  - Each ship can move by one space forwards or backwards every turn
  - Ships can 'skip' sideways, but if they do, they miss the next movement turn


Mines
-----
- Mines are like shells
  - Except that if they do not hit a target, they remain in the square they are targetted at
  - If a ship moves into that square the mine will detonate

- This means that mines are significantly more powerful than standard shells
  - They have the same value as shells for a direct hit
  - They also have the additional benefit of damaging ships which move into their square

- SO: They must cost more to use than standard shells
  - Otherwise there is no point to standard shells, and everyone would always use mines

- The existence of mines acts as a deterrent to moving ships
