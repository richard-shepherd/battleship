Overview
--------
AIs play batteleships against each other.



Coding competition criteria
---------------------------
- The challenge has to be easy enough to be accessible
  - But also interesting enough to be a challenge

- Ideally you should be able to write a simple AI in less than an hour
  - But also that there is enough complexity to write more interesting AIs

- There must be no straightforward best solution to the game



Extensions to the standard rules
--------------------------------
- I think that the standard rules are too simple

- I suspect that there is a optimal strategy with the standard rules
  - So this would not give enough scope for AIs to differentiate themselves

- Ideas for rule extensions
  - Moving ships
  - Mines
  - Reconnaissance drones
  - Difference sizes of board (possibly much bigger)
  - Salvo firing (more than one shot per turn)
  - Budget for what you can fire each turn
  - Budget for which ships you start off with

- More than two players?
  - It could be that we play with (say) three or four players at a time
  - I think that could get too complicated, eg alliances
  - And also possibly 'unfair' if players gang up
  - So I think it is best to stick to two players at a time



Moving ships
------------
- This helps avoid the main 'solvability' of the standard game
  - ie, that there could be an optimal algorithm to narrow down where the opponent's ships are

- How many ships should move each turn?

- Maybe each ship can move one square per turn
  - This seems 'realistic', ie that each ship can move

- Perhaps ships can no longer move once they are hit?
  - That might be a shame though as one nice thing would be that a ship can still get away even when it is hit
  - So I think NO to this
  - Otherwise the game seems to devolve to the non moving version
    - ie, you find a ship (somehow) and then blitz it where you find it

- Is it too much if each ship moves each turn?



How do ships move?
------------------
- Ships move one squre per turn

- Ships can move forwards or backwards on the direction of their axis

- Can ships turn?
  - Seems like they should be able to (???)

- How do ships turn?
  - They would need to turn while remaining on the board
  - eg, if they are on the top or bottom row, or near the left or right edges


- I worry that there is a danger of people setting up ships to constantly spin around
  - Possibly around different points (depending on the turning rule)
  - So they end up moving too fast
  - And looking a bit stupid  


- Alternatively, it could be that ships can just 'skip sideways' but stay in their original orientation
  - This does mean that all the ships points change with no overlap
  - Perhaps you can do it, but not every turn?
  - eg, If you skip, then you miss the next movement turn (for that ship?)

- Proposal
  - Each ship can move by one space forwards or backwards every turn
  - Ships can 'skip' sideways, but if they do, they miss the next movement turn



Movement towards the end of the game
------------------------------------
- Does movement make the game too hard towards the end of the game?
  - Especially on a large board

- In an equal game, we could get down to one 2-square ship on each side on a 100x100 board

- By this point, players cannot fire many shots
  - Either with standard single-shot rules
  - Or with ship-based salvos

- If ships did not move, then someone would eventually win by searching through the grid

- With movement, it is possible that the game could never end

- But perhaps the use of reconnaissance drones means this will work better?
  - I think it depends how powerful the drones are in finding ships
  - And whether this makes things too easy in the early game
  - See section on drones

- Another option is that movement could be limited
  - For example, you have only a limited amount of "fuel"
  - You use one unit of fuel each time you move a ship one square
  - So eventually you run out of fuel

- Perhaps the fuel idea helps with sideways movement
  - eg, it takes one unit of fuel to move forwards or backwards
    but it takes n units (the size of the ship) to move sideways?

- I rather like this fuel idea

- An alternative (or additional factor) is the use of mines
  - These mean that movement may eventually result in losing


Fuel
----
- The idea of fuel is that you need to use fuel to move

- This limits movement, particularly towards the end of the game
  - Which helps avoid never ending games

- Should fuel be global or per ship?

- Per ship seems more "realistic"
  - But global is simpler for AIs to manage
  - Also allows for more trade-offs

- Do bigger ships carry more fuel than smaller ships?
  - YES: Would seem more realistic
  - NO:  Would mean that larger ships could move for longer (particularly backwards and forwards) 
         than smaller ships. Unless they take more fuel to move. But then, it might as well be the
         same amount of fuel as for smaller ships, and the same movement cost.

- Having fuel makes movement more of a tactical thing to do
  - As opposed to something you would do all the time
  - eg, you would do it when part of a ship had been hit



Mines
-----
- Mines are like shells
  - Except that if they do not hit a target, they remain in the square they are targetted at
  - If a ship moves into that square the mine will detonate

- This means that mines are significantly more powerful than standard shells
  - They have the same value as shells for a direct hit
  - They also have the additional benefit of damaging ships which move into their square

- SO: They must cost more to use than standard shells
  - Otherwise there is no point to standard shells, and everyone would always use mines

- The existence of mines acts as a deterrent to moving ships
  - Does it deter movement entirely?
  - If so, then the existence of mines breaks the game

- Should players / ships be able to detect mines?
  - Or able to destroy them, eg with depth charges
    - Which they could fire instead of shells into their own area, ahead of movement?
  - I think NO
  - I think that this makes the game more complicated, and does not really add anything

- Maybe mines should have a TTL
  - So they become inactive afer a number of turns
  - That would stop the game board slowly filling up with mines
  - Is that a good thing?

- Without mine TTL movement becomes more and more dangerous as the game progresses
  - So movement is increasingly deterred



Board size
----------
- It could be good to play on a much bigger board
  - eg, 100 x 100

- This would encourage the use of mines and drones




Salvos
------
- There are two main options for salvos:
  - a) You can fire once per ship in each turn
  - b) You can fire once per ship-square in each turn

- With option b) a carrier - covering five squares - could fire five shells in each turn

- Is the salvos feature too powerful when you detect an enemy ship?
  - When you make a successful hit, you know where one part of the ship is
  - So you can them aim a salvo at squares around that
  - Especially if you can fire one shell per ship square, this means you can fire a lot 
    of shells (especially towards the start of the game)
  - On the other hand, this does mean that you use / waste a lot of your fire power on the salvo
  - So there is still a trade off to make

- With a standard game you have these ships: 5, 4, 3, 3, 2
  - So 5 ships
  - Covering 17 squares

- So at the start of the game:
  - Option a) fires 5 shells per turn 
  - Option b) fires 17 shells per turn
  
- Something which would reduce the number of items fired per turn is if some items cost more
  - For example: mines, drones

- On a large board, it could be good to have larger salvos
  - eg 100x100 is 10,000 squares

- So I quite like option b)



Reconnaissance drones
---------------------
- Overview
  - You fire drones at a square
  - They tell you something about ships nearby
  - You can choose to fire drones instead of shells

- What do drones tell you?
  - a1) Everything that exists within some 'radius' (or nxn square, eg 10x10 square)
  - a2) As a1 except that they only report one item (perhaps the nearest one)
  - b1) That they see something in a given direction, eg "ship detected to the north"
  - b2) As b1 except limited to some distance, eg 10 squares

- I quite like b1 or b2
  - ie, they only scan N, S, E, W
  - They report on all four directions, but do not tell you how far the ship is
    - Just that (for example) there is a "ship to the east"

- What cost should drones have?
  - Equivalent to four shells?


- Drone TTL
  - The usefulness of TTL depends on how much the opponent moves their ships
  - If they do not move, then TTL 


- What happens if a drone hits a ship? (Or is hit by a ship which moves into its square)
  - The drone is destroyed
  - But it reports back first that it was hit



Firing cost and TTL
-------------------
- Cost:
  - Shell: 1
  - Mine:  4
  - Drone: 4

- TTL:
  - Shell: 0
  - Mine:  8
  - Drone: 3

- Saving up for higher cost items
  - Towards the end of the game in particular, you may not have enough shots to pay for a higher cost item
  - For example, you may have only one small ship with two shots
  - So you cannot pay for items which cost four shots

- So we allow saving up 
  - Any shots not taken in a turn are saved for subsequent turns

- Is there any danger that saving up breaks the game in some way?
  - For example, you save one shot per turn in the early game
    so that when you get to the end game you have a huge advantage

- I expect that this is not a problem
  - You are at a disadvantage of you do not use your shots early
  - There is the rule that you can only fire one show per ship-square
  - So even if you save up (say) 100 units and have one two-square ship left
    you can only fire two shots per turn

  

Info about shots fired
----------------------
- Should an AI be told about all the shots fired by the opponent?

- In the pen and paper (pnp) game each player does know where the opponent is firing

- But the pnp game does not have movement
  - Knowing where the opponent is targetting could be useful to decide where to move
  - But: It could perhaps be too useful?

- Also, knowing about a miss may be slightly less realistic
  - Especially if a miss if a long way from any ships
  - So the ships would not 'see' them

- An AI should not know where enemy mines are placed
  - So even if shots are reported, it should not be say whether the shot was a shell or a mine
  - So mines which do not hit a ship would just be counted as a miss

- The question is: What is best for the gameplay?
  - Is it better for the gameplay to know where the opponent is targetting or not?

- Proposal: It is better *not* to know about missed shots
  - It would give a large advantage to AIs with good movement algorithms
  - These algorithms may be quite hard to write

- On the other hand:
  - If it turns out that writing the AIs is too easy, then we could add this information 
  - And then people would have to write better movement algorithms

- But initially, let's say that we do not provide this info
