Game management features
------------------------
- Game
  - Plays a game between two AIs
  - Can optionally be shown on a UI board
  - Can optionally be played at full speed or at a slower speed (especially for the UI)

- AIs
  - AIs are discovered from the AIs folder
  - Each one has a file indicating how to launch it: executable + command-line

- Tournament
  - Plays every AI against every other AI
  - Ideally multiple times each
  - Records the total number of wins for each AI

- UI
  - Shows the two game boards
  - Shows ships, mines and drones
  - Shows damage to ships
  - Indicates mine and drone TTL (by colours? by numbers?)
  - Maybe animate some aspects: shots with parabolas? mines and drones with pulsing effect?

- Relationship between the Game and the UI
  - The Game should not control the UI directly
  - Instead, it raises events when updates should be made to the UI
    - Or make updates via an optionally registered object / interface
  - So the two are decoupled

- API
  - Message types for messages sent to AIs and for results received




Code structure
--------------






Loading AIs and communicating with them
---------------------------------------



Validating AI updates
---------------------
- We need to validate updates received from AIs
  - To check that shots are valid, for example:
    - To check that the AI does not make more shots than it is allowed to
    - To check the cost of shots and that the AI has the resources to make them
  - To check that movement is valid



How do we represent the board?
------------------------------
- The Game needs to keep track of the board
  - To check which ships (or parts of ships) have been hit
  - To know where drones and mines are

- For ships, we really need to keep track of the *ship-parts* themselves
  - Not so much the board, as the ships can move

- Is it worth having a board object in memory
  - eg, with each square being some object?

- I suggest NO
  - For larger boards, this could be quite sparsely filled
  - So maybe it is better to just keep track of the objects themselves

- Should we map the objects into a sparse board?
  - eg (4, 5) -> ship[1].part[2]

- This would mean that when a shell (etc) is fired, we can easily check for a hit
  - Without having to loop over every ship for every shell
