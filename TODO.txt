- Write AIs/readme.txt on how to add an AI

- Add the Kraken
  - Game ends if we have N turns without any hits

- Make logging aysnchronous

- Option to log messaging from the game engine
  - To a separate file?
  - To a separate file per AI?

- More efficient algorithm for drone detection?

- Remove drone use from RandomPlayer AI?
  - Have a Python sample which uses drones

- Write tests

- Make the RandomPlayer place ships without overlapping
  - Maybe all vertical or all horizontal, to make this easier?

- I think I've seen a shell hit in the UI, but the ship-part not be set as damaged!
  - Could it be that the ship had moved into the square *after* the shell had been fired?
  - We may want to render the two phases of the turn separately?

- Make Python sample run without full path to python.exe
